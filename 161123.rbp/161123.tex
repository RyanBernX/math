\begin{document}
Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ be a set of real numbers.
$C=(c_{ij})\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is a matrix and the entries of $C$
is defined as $c_{ij}=|a_i|+|a_j|-|a_i-a_j|$. Prove that $C$ is positive
semidefinite.\emph{Hint: you can permute the rows and columns of $C$ so
that it could have blocked structure.}
